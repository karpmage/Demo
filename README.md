# Demo

This a group project done by me and 3 other peers. I am proud of this document because we got a very high grade (98%) and it gave me experience working as a team on a computer science project. 

This project was done for my Human Computer Interaction paper, which focused on creating a good website and UI experience. Hence, there was no coding done for it, but we did make a low-fidelity paper prototype of the website. We also created several user profiles and theorised how they might engage with the website. At the end of the paper, we reminisce over the challenges we overcame during the process.

We had several meetings for this project. The first few focused on the design on the website itself. We used a whiteboard to brainstorm and draw website designs til we settled on one we all agreed with.

After our website design was finished, we assigned each group member a role. For example, one of us was in charge of building the paper prototype. I was personally in charge of writing up our challenges section, the scenarios and biographies for the personas. We colloborated again and made some tweaks until we were happy with the finished document. Then we used our paper prototype to create a video enacting our scenarios.
